After 5 years , The community of buyers will vote for whether they are really satisfied with the Builders Project
The whole ethers will get transferred to the smart contract balance only after the successful voting of more than 51% by the buyers , this ethers will get transferred from the smart contract balance to the Builders account address.
The whole supervision of the conditions will be done by the smart contract only ( i.e . The require statements which we will be using in our smart contract code)
